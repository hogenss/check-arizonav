# Check ArizonaV

The script bypasses the protection of the Arizona V forum and counts the number of verified complaints by the administration.

## How it works 
Python task consists of code running with selenium web driver. The code was made for the convenience of the administration, or for curious people who are interested in information.

The code can be used not only to check complaints against players, but also for other purposes.
If you want to change the section in which complaints will be checked, then you will need to change the number in the link "forum.arizona-v.com/forums/129/"

Good luck in learning open source code
